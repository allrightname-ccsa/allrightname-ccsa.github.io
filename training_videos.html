The next best thing is to learn on land before going out. Impress the skipper with words like &quot;tack&quot; and &quot;gybe&quot;. The following videos go through the basics of sailing in hopes to get your butt to a helm faster!.<br />

Although the race was at Carlyle Lake with the Caryle Sailing Association, or CSA or &quot;Our Big Cousin's Sailing Club&quot;, it is a good example of a sailboat race. Keep in mind, most of the boats racing at our lake are one to three person boats.</td>

        <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You just survived watching our Training Videos on your computer! Are you ready to get in the water? Go buy a pair of sailing gloves, find a skipper go crew! How do you find a skipper you say? Help us setup a boat before a race. Skippers typically arrive 1-2 hours before the first race on a race day. Find a skipper, introduce yourself, show him or her your new shiny, new glove smelling gloves and say you want to learn how to sail. Remember, ALL of us began as crew.</p></td>
